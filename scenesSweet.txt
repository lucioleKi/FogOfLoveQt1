But could you please stop using my clothes without asking me!	Wow, you look incredible! Like a hotter version of me!	You think so?

It's just your brain playing tricks on you. It's probably just stress.	Ha ha! That's funny! Perhaps you should check your eyesight. Or your brain.	I've also seen a ghost. But that's some years ago.

Any choices made on the next SCENE will count as if it was the other player who made them.

The OTHER will therefore get the PERSONALITY TOKENS from the choice made by the CHOOSER.
