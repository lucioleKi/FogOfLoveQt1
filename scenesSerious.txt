1	WHERE SHOULD WE LIVE?	Where do you think we should live?	N	1	B	Downtown, close to everything.	In a quiet suburb.	Out in the country.	Slow down! I don't want to move in together just yet.
2	TWO SEPARATE PARTIES	It seems like we're going to two separate parties tonight. I hope you have fun!	BOTH choose what happened during the night.	1	B	Cannot. Remember. Too. Many. Drinks.	My friends and I talked all night. It was very intimate and thoughtful.	I talked with somebody - can't remember who. We also kissed. Just for fun.
3	IF ANYBODY ASKS	If anybody - like the police - asks, please tell them I was with you last Thursday night.	N	1	P	Whatever you need.	No way, I'm not going to lie for you!
4	THE TOILET SEAT	Should the seat be up or down? And what about the lid?	N	1	B	Both the seat and lid should be down.	Both the seat and lid should be left up.	Seat should be left down and lid left up.	Just leave it like you used it.
5	SHOULD MY EX COME TO OUR PARTY?	My ex has been asking about our party. I think everything is okay between us since our breakup. But is that enough for an invitation?	How do you BOTH respond to this situation?	1	B	No way!	Why not?	We should invite the ex over more often. To all our parties. Even our wedding... If we have one.
6	TRAVEL PLANNING	While planning this trip, should we avoid places where we can't kiss in public?	N	1	B	I don't have a problem with going to places like that, as long as there's good food.	Well, if it's only one stop on the trip, but I want us to be ourselves when we're on a vacation.	I will never support places where that is the case!	Whatever you think is right, dear.
7	PRIDE PARADE	Hey, do you think we should attend the Pride Parade this year?	N	1	B	Of course! We should fight for what is right!	I don't think that there's any reason for us to go there. People already know what we stand for.	Pride parade? Why on earth should we go there? I would rather hang out with you at home.
8	COULD YOU PAY FOR THIS?	This gold watch is cool. Oh! I forgot my wallet. Can you pay for it?	N	1	P	Hmm. No problem. How about that bracelet too? I hope it won't ruin me.	Eh... (looking very overwhelmed) ... um... oh... okay.	I can lend you some money. With interest.
9	JOINT BANK ACCOUNT	It could be practical to have a joint bank account. But how much should we pool?	N	1	B	Let's pool everything together like a real couple.	I don't think it's a good idea. It would be difficult to handle... ahem... taxes.	We need this much for living. And that much for fun. And that much for... We should each pool 28% to have a buffer.
10	GET A TATTOO	I think you should get a tattoo with my name, just so it's really clear how committed you are.	How do you react?	1	P	OK. Good idea. You know I love you and that I will never leave you.	What?!? Disfigure my body? No way. I love you, but this is not the right way to show it.	(Sobbing) Isn't saying the words enough?
11	WE NEED TO LOSE SOME WEIGHT	It's great to be together, but I think we're getting chubby. Let's do something about it! The only way to succeed is to do it together and support each other.	N	1	P	Yes! Whatever it takes.	What? You think I'm fat?	Forget about it. I'm happy as I am.
12	ONLINE TEST	Did you see that online test about what role you have in the relationship?	How do you both react?	1	B	It's just silly fun. I took the test and came out as "the man" in our relationship.	It's just silly fun. I took the test and came out as "the woman" in our relationship.	I won't take the test. Gender roles are a social construct created by a heteronormative patriarchy.	I would never take such a test. They're a waste of time!
13	WHO'LL DO THE CLEANING?	It's so messy here. We must do something about it.	N	1	B	It's best you do it. I'm not so great at cleaning.	I'll do it. I'm good at it.	We'll share. Anything else is unfair.	We'll not clean at all.
14	SWITCH JOBS	I had a thought this morning. I'm not sure about it. Should we exchange jobs?	N	1	B	I wouldn't mind your pay, but I think you should continue doing most of your work. It's still your job.	I don't mind getting to know more about what it's like to be you. Let's do it!	I hate to say it, but it's a fantasy. It isn't possible in real life.
15	HOW MANY?	How many people have you been with before me?	How does the PARTNER respond and what answer would the PLAYER prefer?	1	B	None. You are and will be the only one.	Well... of course I've been with a few others. I can give you the details. If you want.	That's not important. It's in the past.	A lot. More than 20. Honestly, I've lost count.
16	ARGUMENT WITH PARENTS-IN-LAW	(PLAYER to in-laws) I can't believe you have the nerve to come to our house and say something like that. It is completely uncalled-for. (PLAYER to PARTNER) And you! Are you just going to stand there watching?	N	1	P	(Stand with your partner.)	(Avoid the conflict, and do nothing.)
17	CONVERT TO ANOTHER RELIGION	We've been tiptoeing around this subject too long. Should one of us convert?	What will each of you do? Will one change to the other?	1	B	I will convert to your religion.	I will not change my religion.
18	GORGEOUS ALEX	Let me introduce you to my friend Alex. I hope it's OK if I leave the two of you alone for a couple of hours.	Gorgeous Alex is flirting heavily with you. How do you react?	1	P	I'll be good... I'll be good... I can ignore it...	I... I... I... oh... ah... AAH... yes!... more...	Who cares about a little kiss?
19	MY BOSS JUST CALLED	Sorry, but I can't go out tonight. Something came up at work.	Your date is cancelled. How do you react?	1	P	It's OK. I understand. These things happen.	If you want to see me again, you better make this up to me.	No problem at all. I'm going out anyway. Don't wait up.
20	IT'S JUST SOME PROBLEMS AT WORK	Something is nagging me at work. Just a bit. What should I do?	How does the PLAYER hope the PARTNER will react and how does the PARTNER react?	1	B	You should ignore it.	You should just work harder.	Quit and take some time off.	Can you learn something from this?
21	COUPLES THERAPY	I'm happy that we decided to see a couples therapist.	How do you approach this?	1	B	Ok, now that I'm being honest, it's not my fault.	Perhaps it's just me?	What happened is our shared responsibility. We need to fix this together.
22	FIRST VISIT TO IKEA	Let's go to IKEA. It'll be fun...	How do you both approach furniture shopping?	1	B	We really don't need much. We have so much stuff already.	Whoa! Let's get this! This! This! That! This! And this! And...	I'm sure we can find something that suits us both. What are you interested in?	I really don't care. Just get what you want.
23	WHO PAYS FOR THE DATE?	(Server after the meal, clearly not sure if you're a couple) Separate check?	N	1	B	One check (pay for you both).	(Wait to see if partner offers to pay).	Separate checks please.	Oh uh. I forgot my wallet. Can you pay?
24	ADOPTING A LOST PET	Look what I found! This adorable thing needs a proper home. I think we should adopt it.	N	1	P	Of course. We'll take care of him!	That would be too much work. I'd rather spend time with you having fun.	I know an old lady who takes care of strays. She'll be happy to help this one out.
25	SMALL WORLD	This is my ex, we... Oh, you know each other?	N	1	P	We went to the same chess club in school. What a coincidence!	We were in the same sports team, and got kicked out because we both slacked off too much. We lost touch after that.	That's my ex too. Guess our tastes are similar.	That's the jerk from last week! How were you ever attracted to them?
26	IT'S NOT THAT FAR AWAY	I got a great job offer in another city. It's not that for away. We could probably see each other every week.	How do you both approach this potential change?	1	B	No problem. That's what video calls were made for.	That's awful. But we need the money to build a future together.	I love you so much. We should never be apart.
27	BI	I'm bisexual. I just didn't have the nerve to tell you.	If not revealed before the finale. PLAYER may swap in SELF-REALIZATION during the FINALE | if you swap in SELF-REALIZATION, you'll use it as your final DESTINY.	1	C	Hey, that's cool. You should have told me, but this changes nothing.	This is hurtful. Are you even attracted to me?	Is that even worth keeping a secret? I'm pansexual, and I love you!	I'm confused. What does this mean for us?
28	DON'T FORGET OUR ANNIVERSARY	Honey. Dear. Please don't forget our anniversary. Are you listening to me?	If this SCENE is not revealed at the end of the game: The PARTNER forgot your anniversary. 	1	C	Happy anniversary! I've booked a flight this afternoon. Bags are picked...	Happy anniversary! This is a fine day... like any other.
29	I'M SLOWLY STARTING A BUSINESS	I'm still not sure about this. There's so much work to do. But in the end, it'll be good for both of us.	BOTH +2 satisfaction at the end of the game if you did not BREAK UP.	1	C	Why did you keep this a secret?	I don't think this is a good idea. We need more time together.	That sounds like fun, hard work. Count me in.
30	BUT I DO AGREE!	N	N	1	R	Play right after you made a CHOICE (not in CHAPTER).	You can alter your choice to the same choices as the OTHER before resolving any effects of the choice.	PLAYER draw a new SCENE right after playing this.
