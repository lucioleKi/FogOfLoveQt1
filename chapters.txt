Get a fabulous lunch and lots of sit-down time to really talk and get to know each other.	Go to a karaoke bar. Do a lot of silly serenades and electrify the room with your favorite song. It's a great way to avoid awkward silence.	Pretend to be a tourist. Go sightseeing and share your impressions as you enjoy the attractions and each other's company.
2	1	6	1	THIS IS GOING REALLY WELL!	You seem to have a great connection. But how great is it really?	I haven't told anyone yet, but we're destined to be together! I'm so in love it hurts!	We really have a good connection. This could be the start of something beautiful.	I guess this could be something down the line. But I think we're off to a slightly rocky start.
3	1	6	2	DREAMS	You are discussing your future and dreams. Where do you see yourself in ten years?	Married with kids.	Still living a life with no obligations.	Knowing who I am and what I want.
