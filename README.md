# FogOfLoveQt1
A GUI version of the two-player board game Fog of Love made using QT. Still in progress.

I made a complete console version of Fog of Love here: https://github.com/lucioleKi/FogOfLove. Check it out!

Please support the Fog of Love designers and buy the actual board game. I own a copy of this game. This coding project is personal and not for profit. I am a programmer, but not a game designer. I do not intend to encourage any copyright infringement or piracy here.

Completed: Character creation and synopsis page. I've realized that my talent in UI design is totally non-existent LOL.

Next step: Chapter and choose scene.
