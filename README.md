# FogOfLoveQt1
A GUI version of the two-player board game Fog of Love made using QT. Completed for now, but not all features are implemented.

Here is my demo video of a testing playthrough: https://youtu.be/XEzVSNn-klg.

I made a complete console version of Fog of Love here: https://github.com/lucioleKi/FogOfLove. Check it out!

Please support the Fog of Love designers and buy the actual board game. I own a copy of this game. This coding project is personal and not for profit. I am a programmer, but not a game designer. I do not intend to encourage any copyright infringement or piracy here.

---Development Log---

8/15/2022

Completed: Character creation and synopsis page. I've realized that my talent in UI design is totally non-existent LOL.

Next step: Chapter and choose scene.

8/21/2022

Completed: Chapter page, Board page (where one can see player status and personality tokens). Improved the overall structure of various objects.

Next step: Main game loop for regular scenes first. The plan is to make a 3-page-UI for choosing a scene->display the scene->resolve the scene.

Implemented most personality-token and satisfaction related events. Fixed bugs at scene selection.

10/2/2022

Implemented resolution. The game is now completely playable, but missing certain features. Features not implemented include: reveal secret, situation, destiny, special effects. I uploaded my testing playthrough video onto youtube. 

As I explained in the video, I choose not to refactor those features into this version because the process will be repetitive. I would rather use this time for active learning. Another reason is that I now realize how many things I've done wrong when making Fog of Love. Fixing them all for this project is less efficient than just starting the next one. As I've said before, I am not implementing those games for anything else but to learn about game development as much as possible. 

Qt is a versatile GUI platform. I learned a lot about its signal and slot system. It can cause irritating bugs, but I would recommend it nevertheless for C++ GUI. 

Cheers and off to my next jouney!
