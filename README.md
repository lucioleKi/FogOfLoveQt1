# FogOfLoveQt1
A GUI version of the two-player board game Fog of Love made using QT. Still in progress.

I made a complete console version of Fog of Love here: https://github.com/lucioleKi/FogOfLove. Check it out!

Please support the Fog of Love designers and buy the actual board game. I own a copy of this game. This coding project is personal and not for profit. I am a programmer, but not a game designer. I do not intend to encourage any copyright infringement or piracy here.

---Development Log---

8/15/2022

Completed: Character creation and synopsis page. I've realized that my talent in UI design is totally non-existent LOL.

Next step: Chapter and choose scene.

8/21/2022

Completed: Chapter page, Board page (where one can see player status and personality tokens). Improved the overall structure of various objects.

Next step: Main game loop for regular scenes first. The plan is to make a 3-page-UI for choosing a scene->display the scene->resolve the scene.
